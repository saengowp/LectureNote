## Aristotelian and Boolean standpoint about universal proposition

(reading material)[https://www.uky.edu/~rosdatte/phi120/cntablea.htm]

In aristotelian standpoint, If the claim All S are in P and S actually exist, you can add X to the unshaded zone in S. Boolean reject adding X without additional premise
and call it existential import.

**Conditional Valid**: Only valid from aristotalean
