# Argument By Analogy

Argument by analogy does *not* mean any comparison.
Argument by Analogy must use comparison to convince that similar conclusion must followed.
It should be note that not only does argument by analogy is an induction, it is easily flawed.

## Structure

- A has ... properties
- B also has the same sproperties
- A has X
- Conclusion: B also must has X

## Pitfall

If the highlighted common properties is unrelated to the effect, then the argument is flawed.

The highlighted properties must cover all properties that leads to *sufficient* condition.

But nonetheless, we should study it because it's common method of argument so we should analyse it.

1. Is the condition sufficient?
2. Is the compared entity similar?
3. Is the condition correlated with the conclusion?
4. Any evidence to support?
