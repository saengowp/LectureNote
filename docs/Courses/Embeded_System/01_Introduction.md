- Homework

## Computer Architecture and Computer Organization

- Architecture: Attributes that are visible to programme eg. intruction set
- Organization: Unit that realize the architecture. Not visible eg. hardware details

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

- ISA is the structure of a computer
- Programmer must understand ISA to write programs
- Hardware designer must also understand ISA to implement it correctly
- Act as an interface between hardware designer and programmer

**Example**

- IBM System/370

## Function of a computer

- Data Processing
- Data Storage
- Data Movement
- Control

## Main structural component of the computer

- CPU
- Main Memory
- I/O
- System Interconnection

### CPU 

- Control Unit
- ALU
- Register
- CPU Interconnect

### Cache

- Fast memory for caching Main Memory

## History of Computer

Initially the computer were used for war-effort eg. calculating tragetory, decryptng enemy code.

- Vacuum Tube
- Transistor
- Integrated Circuit

### Evolution of Architecture

- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer): eg. x86
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer): Easier to do pipelining eg. ARM

## Embeded System

- Electronic and Software specifically designed for the product

## Cloud Computing

- On-demand shared-pool of computational resources that can be allocate with minimal effort

## Moore's Law

- Transistor density grows exponentially
- The law will soon be restricted by the limitation of CMOS technlogy
