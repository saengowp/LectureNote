# Polling

When consider accuracy of the poll, we should consider following factors

- **Does it appeal to Authority?** Does the poll relies only on the expert's credential but not data?
- **Who did the polling?** Do they have financial, political interest in the result?
- **Method of polling?** Should the poll be anonymous?
- **What are poll question?** Can the respondant freely express their opinion using the given choices? Leading question?
- **Partial presentation of data** 
- **Does the conclusion necessarily follows?** 
	- Can the question used in the poll infers the presented conclusion?
	- Is the conclusion misleading or overstated the data?

# Mill's method

Two kind of causes

- Necessary
- Sufficient

## Finding Causes

John Stuart Mill suggest the following methods for finding causes.

### Method of Agreement

Find the common causes of the effect.

### Method of difference

Compare the causes when the effect appeared and when the effect didn't appear.

### Joint Method of Agreement and Difference

Using medthod of aggreement when the effect appeared and disappeared.

### Method of concomitant variation

Measure the magnitude of the causes and the magnitude of the effect

## Problem with Mill's method

- We can't enumerate all environment/causes
- Will not establish causation
- We may not discover all possible observation

## Fallacy of Causality

### Post-hoc fallacy

Conclude the effect and cause just because it appear together.

### Fallacy of Confusing Cause and Effect

Conclude that A causes B when B actually causes A

### Fallacy of Common Causes

A causes B and C. But conclude that B causes C.
