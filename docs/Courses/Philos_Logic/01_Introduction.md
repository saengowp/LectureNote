# Reasoning

Reasoning consist of

- Premise
- Conclusion
- Relationship between them

## Kind of reasoning

- Deductive: Premise *must* leads to conclusion
- Inductive: Premise *probably* leads to conclusion

### Deductive

- **Validity** (สมเหตุสมผล): if the premise is true then the conclusion must always be true
- **Sound** (อ้างเหตุผลที่ดี): Premise is true and Reasoning is valid

### Inductive

- **Strong**: highly likely that the conclusion would be true if the premise is true.


## Basic Assumption

Assumption that are not written but needed to make reasoning valid.

- Theory-Ladenness of Observation: When we observe something. we are not totally independent from the theory itself.
- That person is good, but what it mean to be good?
- Prisoner's dilemma: Assume players maximized benefit
- Stereotype
- Religious belief
