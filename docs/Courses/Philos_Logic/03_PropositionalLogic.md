## Term reduction

Using logical equivalences, We can reduce the no. of terms in the proposition.

- Double negation: Not (Not A) = A
- Some A is B = Some B is A
- No A is B = All A is not B
- All A is not B = All B is not A (Mutex)

## Enthymeme

Some part are left out of the argument. due to

- Obviousness
- For rhetoric
- Hiding it because the premise is weak

### Finding missing argument

1. Transform into categorical argument form
2. Find missing argument using venn-diagram.

Missing argument can be either a premise or a conclusion or may not exist in categorical proposition form.
