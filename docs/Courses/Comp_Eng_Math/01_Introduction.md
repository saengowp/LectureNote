# Introduction

## Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is the study of linear system such as

- function of vector to vector
- optimization (finding minimum/maximum) of such function

Several classes of problem can be solved using Linear Algebra.

- Regression (predicting measurement from certain features)
	- Represent input and output as vector
	- Define prediction model (Linear, Quadratic, ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
	- Find model parameter that minimize prediction error
- PageRank (ranking website that was used by Google)
	- Assigning rank based on hyperlink between pages

## Course Objective

In this class we will study

- Relationship and transformation of linear system
- Relationship of linear system to geometry
